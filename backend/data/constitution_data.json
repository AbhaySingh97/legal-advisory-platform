Kesavananda Bharati challenged these laws, arguing they violated his fundamental rights. The case expanded to challenge constitutional amendments that asserted Parliament's unlimited power to amend the Constitution.\n\nThe 13-judge Supreme Court bench delivered a historic 7:6 verdict, establishing the 'Basic Structure Doctrine.' This doctrine states that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution, it cannot alter its essential features or 'basic structure,' such as the supremacy of the Constitution, the rule of law, independence of the judiciary, separation of powers, secularism, and federalism. This judgment ensured that the Constitution remains the supreme law of the land, protecting it from legislative overreach and safeguarding fundamental democratic principles."

      "detailed_explanation": "Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015) was a pivotal case for online free speech. It challenged Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which criminalized sending 'offensive' or 'menacing' messages online. The provision was widely criticized for its vagueness and misuse to arrest individuals for dissenting political opinions. The Supreme Court struck down Section 66A as unconstitutional, ruling that it violated the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression under Article 19(1)(a). The Court found the terms 'annoyance' and 'inconvenience' to be undefined and overbroad, failing to fall within the reasonable restrictions of Article 19(2). This judgment protects citizens from arbitrary arrests for online expression and reinforces the importance of clear, precise laws when restricting fundamental freedoms."

Shayara Bano, a survivor of this practice, challenged it along with polygamy and nikah halala, arguing they violated the fundamental rights of Muslim women to equality and dignity. A 5-judge Constitution Bench, in a 3:2 majority, held that instant Triple Talaq was 'manifestly arbitrary' and violative of Article 14 (Right to Equality). The Court ruled that the practice was not an essential part of Islam and could not be protected under religious freedom. This judgment was a major victory for gender justice, leading to the enactment of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which criminalized the practice."

It established a 50% ceiling on total reservations, ruling that reservation is an exception to the rule of equality and cannot exceed this limit. It also introduced the concept of the 'creamy layer,' excluding wealthy and socially advanced members of backward classes from reservation benefits. The court also held that reservation applies only to initial appointments and not to promotions."

In a 4:1 controversial verdict (Justice H.R. Khanna dissenting), the Supreme Court held that during an Emergency, citizens have no locus standi to move court for any enforcement of rights, even the Right to Life (Article 21). This judgment was later overruled by the Puttaswamy judgment (Privacy case) and the 44th Amendment acted to prevent Article 21 from ever being suspended again."

The Supreme Court admitted her claim, ruling that CrPC overrides personal laws when they conflict on such matters. This caused a backlash from orthodox sections who saw it as interference in Muslim Personal Law. The government subsequently enacted the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, to nullify the judgment's effect, restricting maintenance to the 'iddat' period."
